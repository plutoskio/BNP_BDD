3“Are we working asefficiently aspossible onourdesks?”
From an operational perspective, the goal is to understand :
▪where time is lost,
▪where processes slow down,
▪which activities could be streamlined.
By observing the desks’ activities, can we identify areas where productivity can be improved, organisational bottlenecks, and
opportunities to streamline workflows?
From these observations, can we map out the current treatment paths and highlight where optimisation is needed.
Outcome:
A diagnostic view of operational efficiency, highlighting where improvements can be targeted to reduce friction and optimise 
the organisation at scale.
Deliverable :
At the end of the HOBART Hack Quest, we expect each team to submit a concise analysis report presenting your key insights 
backed by evidence.
The format is entirely up to you —graphs, dashboards, tables, or any visual layout that best illustrates your findings.
What matters is that your visuals are supported by a clear written reflection explaining how you interpreted the data and the
conclusions you drew from it.Our Head of Operations

[Page 4]
4“How can we improve ourclients’ day todayexperience?”
Client Service Managers will focus on what the data reveals about :
▪client pain points,
▪workload distribution,
▪service consistency .
From your observations, what takeaways are most relevant for Client Service Managers? Which desks handle the highest volume o r the most 
sensitive topics? Can we
identify clear patterns in how requests are processed and resolved? How can these insights help us better anticipate client n eeds and enhance 
service quality?
Outcome:
An actionable understanding of how internal dynamics translate into client experience —and where to improve responsiveness, trans parency, 
and overall service quality.
Deliverable :
▪At the end of the HOBART Hack Quest, we expect each team to submit a concise analysis report presenting your key insights bac kedby 
evidence.
▪The format is entirely up to you —graphs, dashboards, tables, or any visual layout that best illustrates your findings.
▪What matters is that your visuals are supported by a clear written reflection explaining how you interpreted the data and the conclusions you 
drew from it.Our Client Service Managers (CSMs)

[Page 5]
5“Are the inputs accurate enough tosupport meaningful insights?”
This persona focuses on data hygiene , workflow accuracy , and KPI reliability .
Looking at the quality of data entered in Hobart, which desks show incomplete or incorrect entries? How do inter -desk transfers reflect the 
real workflow, and what can we
infer from these movements? What do the provided data teach us about working relationships and coordination between desks? Wh ichkey 
data points are essential for
capturing the true stakes and constraints of our organisation?
Outcome:
A clear picture of data quality gaps, leading to better training, improved tool usage, and stronger foundations for analytics .
Deliverable :
▪At the end of the HOBART Hack Quest, we expect each team to submit a concise analysis report presenting your key insights bac kedby 
evidence.
▪The format is entirely up to you —graphs, dashboards, tables, or any visual layout that best illustrates your findings.
▪What matters is that your visuals are supported by a clear written reflection explaining how you interpreted the data and the conclusions 
you drew from it.Our Hobart Quality Monitoring Team

[Page 6]
6“What unexpected patterns inthe data could help usreinvent ourservice?”
This is the wild card , where creativity meets analytics.
▪Can we surface hidden patterns and ‘fun facts’ that traditional analyses might miss?
▪What surprising insights about client behaviour, workload distribution, or workflow dynamics emerge when we look
at the data differently?
▪Can our apprentice data scientists showcase novel angles —e.g., weak signals, anomalies, or cross -desk relationships —
that suggest new ways to create value?
▪Which unconventional data features (or combinations) appear most promising to pilot improvements in our service model?
Outcome:
Creative insights that help rethink processes, identify new levers for service improvement, or imagine smarter workflows —not jus t optimise 
the existing ones.
Deliverable :
▪At the end of the HOBART Hack Quest, we expect each team to submit a concise analysis report presenting your key insights bac ked
by evidence.
▪The format is entirely up to you —graphs, dashboards, tables, or any visual layout that best illustrates your findings.
▪What matters is that your visuals are supported by a clear written reflection explaining how you interpreted the data and the conclusions 
you drew from it.Our Innovation Manager

26What is A Service Request, a Query ? 
A Query refers to any question, request, or complaint submitted by an 
internal contact, client, or third party to the dedicated Securities Services 
teams. These can be received through various channels such as email, 
phone, messaging, fax, or the "New My Queries" platform.
A query includes any item received at a Hobart desk that requires action 
from our teams. Queries can range from simple inquiries handled by 
Level 1 (L1) teams to more complex cases that may involve escalation to 
Level 2 (L2), Level 3 (L3), or Level 4 (L4) teams.Service request (SR) –It’s a ticket and acts as a folder for all the 
communications taken place on one particular query generated by a 
client (internal or external).

[Page 27]
Hobart key concepts : what is in our data sets ?
Intro to Hobart July 2025 27Task (other name = Activity)
When you create a Service Request but you need another user’s or team’s 
contribution or to obtain information from them, you can now create a 
TASK.  A Task acts as a sub folder within SR which contains all the 
communication with L2 team. It allows you to monitor the status of the 
action on the task.
The person who receives the task can create a TASK REQUEST (similar to a 
Service Request)Warning = ACTIVITY DOESN’T 
MEAN ACTIVITY
Desk
A desk is a common operational digital space shared by a team, just like 
a work desk in real life 
A desk contains all the emails and communications received in the 
Hobart team mailbox
Each desk has its own mailbox and a desk name. A desk can be 
customised according to needs during or after onboarding.
One user can be part of multiple desks and can switch between them as 
per choice

Our head of 
operations“Are we working as efficiently as possible on our desks?”
By observing the desks’ activities, can we identify areas where productivity can be improved, organisational bottlenecks, and opportunities to streamline workflows?
From these observations, can we map out the current treatment paths and highlight where optimisation is needed?
Our client 
service 
managers“How can we improve our clients’ day -to-day experience?”
From your observations, what takeaways are most relevant for Client Service Managers? Which desks handle the highest volume o r the most sensitive topics? Can we 
identify clear patterns in how requests are processed and resolved? How can these insights help us better anticipate client n eeds and enhance service quality?

 Subject: The HOBART Quest at BNP Paribas    Dear Students,    I’m Jean-Marc Friess, Chief Digital Services Officer at BNP Paribas Securities Services. Next week, you’ll join our teams in what we call the HOBART Quest — a Business Deep Dive that is as real as it gets.   HOBART is our in-house query management tool. It sits at the core of how we serve our clients every day. It connects 1,300+ desks, 5,000+ users, and 25+ locations worldwide — handling a constant flow of internal and external queries.  Every question we receive becomes a Service Request (ticket), and teams collaborate through desks and task requests to solve it.   It works — but it could work better. And that’s where you come in.    
💡 Your Mission  This Business Deep Dive is not a case study or a simulation. It’s a real optimization challenge. We run HOBART at scale, and we need fresh perspectives to help us cut through the noise and make smarter decisions with the data we have.   You will explore one of four critical use cases, each rooted in our daily operations and strategic priorities — more details to come on Monday, Feb 2nd during the kick off session: • Operational Efficiency  • Client Experience  • Data Quality  • Innovation & AI  Each persona asks the same question from a different angle: How do we make better decisions with the data we already have?

⚙ What We Expect From You  AI won’t solve this for you. You’re dealing with a scale of complexity where tools alone aren’t enough. You need to prioritize, lead, and innovate.  We’re counting on you to:  • Use your critical thinking to see patterns where others see noise.  • Challenge our assumptions and propose fresh perspectives.  • Transform insight into actionable solutions that could shape how we work tomorrow. This is your chance to make an impact on a system used every day by thousands of BNP colleagues and clients around the world.    
🧭 A Final Word  This Deep Dive is for those who want to own the problem, not just run the report. You’ll be guided by our teams from Paris and Lisbon, and we will be following your progress closely. We believe that your creativity, your data mindset, and your ability to turn information into insight can make a real difference.   On Monday, I’ll join you for the Kick-Off to launch the HOBART Quest alongside Suzana Tadic and Anne-Laure Villanova. We can’t wait to see what you will build, discover, and challenge over the next few weeks.   Let’s get to work — and let’s make HOBART smarter together.   Warm regards,    Jean-Marc Friess Chief Digital Services Officer BNP Paribas Securities Services
