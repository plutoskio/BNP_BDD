# 🎱 Pinball Effect: Executive KPI Report

**Goal:** Quantify the "Ping-Pong" behavior of tickets between departments.

## 1. The Chaos Factor (Global Transfer Metrics)
*   **Average Hops per Ticket:** 1.32
*   **Median Hops:** 1
*   **The "90th Percentile" Nightmare:** 10% of tickets hop at least **2 times**.
*   **Maximum Observed Hops:** 76 (The "Champion")

## 2. "Hot Potatoes" (Extreme Pinball)
*   **Tickets with 5+ Transfers:** 47 tickets (0.92%)
    *   *Insight:* These 47 cases represent the "frozen middle" – tickets that consume disproportionate management time.

## 3. The "Loop" Index (Inefficiency)
*   **Loop Rate:** **17.88%** of transferred tickets return to a desk they already visited.
    *   *Meaning:* A loop (A $\rightarrow$ B $\rightarrow$ A) is a pure waste of time. 17.88% of multi-desk tickets suffer from this.

## 4. Top "Ricochet" Desks (Biggest Senders)
*Who is pushing work away the most?*
